   <h2>Goal Setting</h2>
  <body> 
     <section>
    <main> 
      <p> My key to staying motivated day-to-day and month-by-month is by setting goals. My goals are both short and long term, but if I don't have an attainable plan as to how I will achieve them, I won't succeed. The key to following through and achieving your goals is to set yourself up for success and make a detailed plan.</p>
    </main>
      <p>As of March 2023, these are the current goals that I have been working towards:</p>
      <dl>
       <dt>Staying active</dt>
       <dd>Each week I've gone to between two and four Dragonfly Yoga classes. I typically go to variations of their Flow 60 and barre classes (both hot), and it always is one of the best parts of my day. I also try to always get at least 10,000 steps in a day, which is easier some days than others depending on my class schedule.</dd>
       <dt>Stay on top of my work</dt>
       <dd>This semester has definitely been my hardest, especially because I recently started a job tutoring Chemistry through UW Athletics. I have had to make more of an effort to wake up early to get done everything I want to in a day, as well as making the most of my weekends to catch up and get ahead. A great tool for me this semester has been using Google Calendar. It helps me to keep all of my meetings, due dates, and work schedule straight.</dd>
       <dt>Quality time with friends</dt>
       <dd>Maintaining a healthy balance in my life and having fun/spending time with my friends is essential for my mental health. Whether it's getting ice cream on a week night, watching a show, getting coffee, or going out, I like to make sure I'm able to have a break from my busy days to improve my relationsips.</dd>
       <dt>Save money</dt>
       <dd>More specifically, I would like to make the same amount of money through my tutoring job as I spend. During the week, my biggest weakness is getting an iced coffee as a mood booster; once in a while, this type of treat is great, but I do not want to become dependent on caffeine and an earlier bedtime would solve this as well.</dd>
       <dt>Practice Gratitude</dt>
       <dd>By gratitude journaling and just appreciating the small things that make each day great, I can control and improve my attitude, and overall just become a more positive person. Especially on the days that I get caught up in school, it can be hard to actively practice gratitude and notice the things that are going my way.</dd>
