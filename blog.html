    <h3 class="special">Spring Break Day 1</h3>
<p class="special">Today felt like the longest day ever! I woke up at 5:30 after going to bed at 2:00 AM (not a smart choice but I caught up on physics homework!) and my dad and I headed to the airport. We were relieved when our flight only left about thirty minutes late due to the weather. During our layover in Washington DC, I hopped on my BME lecture since it was online today and got some other work done. I caught up on some Outer Banks on the plane, and we eventually landed in Fort Lauderdale just before 5. For dinner, we decided upon a Cuban restuarant downtown which ended up taking a good 40 minutes to walk to and left me with blisters from my sandals. I ordered brisket with onions that came with rice and beans and a pineapple mojito which was delicious! The pineapple guacamole was amazing as well. I didn't want to tear up my feet any more, so we Ubered back to the hotel and I picked up some shampoo and conditioner before hopping in the shower and getting some more work done the rest of the night. I am super excited to board our cruise ship tomorrow!</p>
