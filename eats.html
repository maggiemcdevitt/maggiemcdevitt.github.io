  <h2> My Favorite Restuarants and Recipes </h3>
  <section>
    <main> 
      <p>I have recently been described as a huge foodie...at first I denied it and then realized how true it is. One of my favorite things to do is try new restaurants in Madison. Whenever I go on vacation with my family, I'm always assigned the task (by choice) of picking the restaurants to eat at. One of my favorite destinations was Charleston, South Carolina this summer as they had over 200 restuarants to choose from...how overwhelming for me! Another tendancy of mine is to look over the whole menu before going to a new restuarant so that I'm able to see what sticks out to me before going; otherwise I would take way too long deciding what I want!

      <h4> Favorite Restuarants in Madison </h6>
      <p> Most recently I went to Red for a special occasion. The food was absolutely amazing! We started with Sticky Wagyu Beef Ribs as an appetizer. The two of us shared the Tropic Thunder signature roll, the Rainbow roll, and an Alaskan roll. 10/10, definitely recommend, and I will be going back!</p>
